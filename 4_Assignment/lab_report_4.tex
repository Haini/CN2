\section{Description of the Solution}

We implement a ns3 simulation based on the given specification and with the help of the examples provided in the ns3 documentation.
Furthermore, the generation of an XML-File for the tool \texttt{NetAnim} is implemented to visualize the created network.
We create another \texttt{NetAnim} compatible XML-File that contains the routing tables of the network nodes.
Static routing tables are computed at compile time with the \texttt{Ipv4GlobalRoutingHelper} library.

The \texttt{EnablePcapAll} function enables pcap output on all devices in the network. 
Note that this function needs to be invoked on \texttt{p2p} and \texttt{csma} device types separately.
This generates files of the type \texttt{prefix-A-B} where \texttt{A} is the node-id and \texttt{B} is the device-id. 
We expect 3 nodes with ID 0 to 2 and two devices IDs 1 and 2. 
A third device ID 0 is present in the routing tables and refers to the local loop back interface. 
Subsequently, four pcap files are generated:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \texttt{assignment4-0-1}
    \item \texttt{assignment4-1-1}
    \item \texttt{assignment4-1-2}
    \item \texttt{assignment4-2-1}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Expected Results}
We expect about 9 seconds of recorded data. 
\subsubsection{Node 0, Interface 1}
Observations at Node 0, Interface 1 should show an outgoing \texttt{ICMP} packet to the address \texttt{10.0.148.2} every 0.2 seconds with a length of 1052 bytes (1024 bytes payload + 28 bytes protocol overhead).
An incoming \texttt{ICMP} packet from the source \texttt{10.0.148.2} to the destination \texttt{10.0.20.1} should arrive after a time of approximately \texttt{(30ms + 2ms * 2) = 64ms}.
The \texttt{ttl} of the incoming packet should be decreased by one, as Node 2 is traversed.
The sent packets should be using P2P Frames. 

\subsubsection{Node 1, Interface 1 (P2P)}
Interface 1 on Node 1 receives messages from Node 0 every 0.2 seconds.
These messages are then forwarded into the subnet \texttt{10.0.148.0} and the answer from the pinged host should (this time relayed from Interface 2) be received after 4ms.
Packets should still be using P2P Frames.
\subsubsection{Node 1, Interface 2 (CSMA)}
Interface 2 on Node 1 forwards the packet to its destination, \texttt{10.0.148.2} and should record an answer from the destination after 4ms.
Packets should have been switched to Ethernet Frames, which most likely will increase the total length of the packets.
\subsubsection{Node 2, Interface 1 (CSMA)}
Node 2 should record a packet on Interface 1 every 0.2 seconds and an outgoing answer to this packet should be recorded immediately.
Packets should be still using Ethernet Frames.

\subsubsection{Output of Ping}
We expect a constant output from the ping tool, i.e. 1032 transmitted bytes, a ttl of 63 and a time of 64ms.

\subsection{Observed Results and Explanation of Deviation}
The observed results match our expectation for the most part. 
We didn't consider that Nodes 1 and 2 may use the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) at the start of the simulation.
The total packet length under the usage of P2P Frames is \textbf{1054} and not 1052 (\texttt{20 Byte Ipv4 + 8 Byte ICMP + 2 Byte P2P}) as the size of the P2P frame was not considered.
The total packet length for Ethernet Frames increases to \textbf{1070} (\texttt{18 Byte Ethernet + 20 Byte IPv4 + 8 Byte ICMP}).

The ping tool reports a time of 83ms for the first ping (Listing \ref{lst:ns3Ping}), this can be attributed to the fact that ARP packets are exchanged in the beginning and the first ping is delayed by that (Listing \ref{lst:ns3ARP}).
